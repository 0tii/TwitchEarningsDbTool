# ðŸ’¾ Twitch Revenue SQLite

Python Script to generate a SQLite database including all revenues from the great Twitch leak. 
This script takes the path to the 'all_revenues' subfolder of the leaked folder tree and an optional parameter.
The script was written in Python3.9 but should run on 3.x

The script works solely on vanilla libraries.

## Usage
Navigate to the folder where main.py resides.

```C:\...\\EarningsTool> py main.py [--all]```

Specify `--all` in order to write all channel data to the database. Else only channels that have revenues > 0 will be stored.

You will be prompted to enter the path to the 'all_revenues' subfolder of the twitch leak folder tree. In order for this script to properly work, you must not alter the original folder tree. Both the full path to the target folder, as well as the relative path from the script directory are valid.

Update as of commit 44f7a60a1787f806dcbb11b634eeac820370be6b: Path now gets checked not only for existence but for validity by subsequent sample validation.

## Output

The script will create a folder `./db_out/` in its directory which will contain the full SQLite database file (database.db) once the script has finished running.

## Structure
The database structure is highly rudimentary. There are two tables:

- earnings - A table with PK of user_id (the twitch channel id), year and month as well as one field for every revenue source and one field for the total_gross of the revenue shares
- user - A table with PK user_id (twitch channel id) and field user_name. Do with this what you will, I use it to fetch username-id connections on request and cache names.
