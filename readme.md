# ðŸ’¾ Twitch Revenue SQLite

Python Script to generate a SQLite database including all revenues from the great Twitch leak. 
This script takes the path to the 'all_revenues' subfolder of the leaked folder tree and an optional parameter.
The script was written in Python3.9 but should run on 3.x

## Usage
Navigate to the folder where main.py resides.

```C:\...\\EarningsTool> py main.py [--all]```

Specify `--all` in order to write all channel data to the database. Else only channels that have revenues > 0 will be stored.

You will be prompted to paste the path to the 'all_revenues' subfolder of the twitch leak folder tree. In order for this script to properly work, you must not alter the original folder tree.

## Output

The script will create a folder `./db_out/` in its directory which will contain the full SQLite database file (database.db) once the script has finished running.

## Structure
The database structure is highly rudimentary. There are two tables:

- earnings - A table with PK of user_id (the twitch channel id), year and month as well as one field for every revenue source and one field for the total_gross of the revenue shares
- user - A table with PK user_id (twitch channel id) and field user_name. Do with this what you will, I use it to fetch username-id connections on request and cache names.
